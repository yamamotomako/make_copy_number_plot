# make_copy_number_plot

This program is made for detecting the abnormal copy number on the chromesome.
USUALLY, we (humans, or another spieces such as mumuls, plants, even as micro-xxxx) have double sets of chromesome that is numbered between 1-22 and x and y. This rule is common for all, then the number of sets of each chromesome is called as copy number, so usually the copy number is two. However, we have sometimes single, or triple or more sets of copy number originally installed. And that abnormal situation sometimes causes cancer, or another genome delivered diseases. Of course, very healthy bodies have that kind of abnormals, but that tiny? changes are not the driver for causing diseases in all life spans.

This tools is aimed for detecting such kind of abnormal number of sets of chromesome and making scattered plots.
When in counting copy number, cancer genome was used and the control (as the comparison) was normal genomes sampled from same humans.
